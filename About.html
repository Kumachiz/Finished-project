   <h2>Why Programming?</h2>

   <p class="why">
    Ever since I was a young child, I was very interested in electronics and always wondered how they worked. During my last year in middle school, I learnt that I could get a major in computer science once I got to high school. To me, that meant that I could get more time to play with <span class="span">computers</span>, or at least try to understand them more. Years later, I learned  that the best way to make computers do what you want them to do was through programming/coding. It stirred in my heart until I graduated high school. After graduating high school I decided to explore more about <em>Epicodus</em> that I had only heard about during one of my computer essentials classes at my high school. I had been told how good the program was, but I wanted to experience it myself. I joined the evening introduction to programming course here at Epicodus and the experience has been incredible!
